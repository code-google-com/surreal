#summary Root page of the wiki

= Introduction =

The Unreal engine is a complex engine, designed from the start to be easily extensible. I will not describe how the engine itself work here, there is already a lot of documentation around the net doing so. This wiki will simply list reference to this documentation and talks about the project itself, difficulties encountered and other issues.


= Details =
[http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/ Beyond Unreal Wiki] : Contains *a lot* of information about the unreal engine itself and file formats used by the engine.

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/utpackages UTPackages] : This is an open source project aimed at creating libraries to read unreal package contents. Sadly it's doing in Delphi (Pascal).

[http://unreal.epicgames.com/Packages.htm] : Unreal package informations directly from Epic. 

[http://www.celticwarriors.net/Website/Mirrors/Epic%20Helpfiles/ Epic Help Files Mirror] : This is a mirror I've found of the Epic help files intended to be used by the engine licensees. 

[http://icculus.org/~chunky/ut/ UT Randomness] : Another website with stuff on UT. Contains the source of UT from the CVS of the defunct Loki.
