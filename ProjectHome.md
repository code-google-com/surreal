Welcome to the Surreal Project Google Code homepage. This project is aimed at reimplementing the Unreal Engine 1.5 version (that is the one used by UT GOTY and Deus Ex).

Most of the work done for now is to reimplement in C# the UT Packages tools from Antonio Corder. I'm currently 50% done prototyping classes and I should start implementing functionalities into soon. For now most of the package management is done using classed and variables. I keeps a kind of VM which links all the package together. In the UE this would be the core. What I'm actually planing is to migrate all the object and package management, which is done by hand, to the CLR. Using reflectivity possibilities I'll be interpretting package and dynamically create assemblies which will be used instead of the native UE format. I expect lots of quirks but I do think that the speed up should be impressive.
